# Frontend Application Usage

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to navigate and interact with the AURA Protocol frontend application. Ensure your wallet is connected as outlined in the [Getting Started](/getting-started) section before proceeding.

## Dashboard Overview

Upon connecting your wallet, you'll be greeted by the AURA Protocol dashboard. This interface is designed to give you a comprehensive overview of the vault's status and your personal investment position.

### 1. Vault Statistics

The top section of the dashboard displays crucial real-time statistics about the AURA Vault:

-   **Total Value Locked (TVL):** This metric indicates the total amount of stablecoin assets currently managed by the AURA Vault. It reflects the overall size and liquidity of the protocol.
-   **Vault APY:** The Annual Percentage Yield offered by the vault. (Note: This is currently a placeholder and will be replaced with real-time calculated APY from the strategy performance).
-   **Current Vault Strategy:** Displays the name of the active yield-generating strategy employed by the vault (e.g., "RWA Arbitrage #3").
-   **Total Profit Generated:** Shows the cumulative profit generated by the vault since its inception. (Note: This is currently a placeholder and will be replaced with real-time data).

### 2. Your Position: Deposit & Withdraw Tabs

This interactive section allows you to manage your assets within the AURA Vault. You can switch between "Deposit" and "Withdraw" tabs.

#### How to Deposit Stablecoins

1.  **Select the "Deposit" Tab:** Ensure you are on the deposit interface.
2.  **View Your Balance:** Check "Your Balance" to see the amount of underlying stablecoins (e.g., USDC) you currently hold in your connected wallet.
3.  **Enter Deposit Amount:** In the input field, enter the amount of stablecoins you wish to deposit into the vault.
4.  **Approve (if necessary):** If this is your first deposit, or if your previous approval is insufficient, an "Approve" button will appear. Click it to grant the AURA Vault permission to spend your stablecoins. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.
5.  **Deposit:** Once approved (or if already approved), the button will change to "Deposit". Click it to confirm your deposit. You will receive vault shares (aTokens) representing your proportional ownership of the vault's assets. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.
    *   *Note: Transaction confirmations may take some time depending on network congestion.*

#### How to Withdraw Stablecoins

1.  **Select the "Withdraw" Tab:** Switch to the withdraw interface.
2.  **View Your Vault Position:** "Your Vault Position" displays the value of your vault shares (aTokens) in terms of the underlying stablecoin.
3.  **Enter Withdraw Amount:** In the input field, enter the amount of vault shares (aTokens) you wish to redeem.
4.  **Withdraw:** Click the "Withdraw" button. This will burn your vault shares and return the corresponding amount of underlying stablecoins to your wallet. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.
    *   *Note: Withdrawals may be subject to a small fee, as indicated in the UI.*
